# Overview #
AEM component to enable automatic updates in Mozilla Fireox.

Some RMM's, such as Continuum, disable these by default. This allows you to re-enable them in mass.

# Building #
Download or fork, run repackage.bat and upload aem-component.cpt to AEM. You can also download the aem-component.zip straight from this repository and install in your AEM instance.
